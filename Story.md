# Story

Here is a short story about this project.

## About us

We are a small team of software developers with a lot of interest in new technologies.

## Why did we build this project?

New games often are available as early access. In this phase the game is not finished, but a fan community can be build and the game designer get already an income.
NFTs are a good way to finance game development but also give the fans the ability to show up they founded the game.
With NFTs, the spirit of the early supporters will be preserved forever.

## How we build it

We developed an nft smart contract in solidity.
We created a clear marketplace frontend.
The contract is deployed to multiple chains.
Within the marketplace, new contracts can be created. Data used by this contract, like a long description, are stored on ipfs via web-storage.
